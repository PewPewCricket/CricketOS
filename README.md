# CricketOS

An Operating system for x86 BIOS systems written in full assembly!

Roadmap:
- Stage 1 Bootloader (DONE)
- Stage 2 Bootloader (WIP)
- Custom Kernel (TODO)
- Basic UNIX-like CLI and Tools (TODO)
- Kernel/Userspace Seperation (TODO)
- Programs to Make the CLI user friendly (TODO)

Don't expect this to be completed or be used by anyone as it is just a fun project to help me learn assembly as it is a great language allowing full optomization of code, I will aim to make the OS as small and minimal as possible, if i even get past the kernel. If you Would like to help, you can contact me on discord, my username is "pewpewcricket".
